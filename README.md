Sphero Ball For Educational Purpose. Made HTML5 app which can control the sphero ball. Makes use of Node.JS


Note:
-----
You need to work around with node.js with this application. All the files are there but some of the files I missing I guess which my founder has accidently deleted them.
The app uses HTML5 and its suppose to use node.js from Sphero Github (Open Source) to control the ball.
